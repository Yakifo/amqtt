==========

``amqtt_sub`` is a command line MQTT client that subscribes to some topics and output data received from messages published.

Usage
-----

``amqtt_sub`` usage : ::

  amqtt_sub --version
  amqtt_sub (-h | --help)
  amqtt_sub --url BROKER_URL -t TOPIC... [-n COUNT] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-i CLIENT_ID] [-q | --qos QOS] [-d]
             [-k KEEP_ALIVE] [--clean-session] [--ca-file CAFILE] [--ca-path CAPATH] [--ca-data CADATA]
             [ --will-topic WILL_TOPIC [--will-message WILL_MESSAGE] [--will-qos WILL_QOS] [--will-retain] ]
             [--extra-headers HEADER]

Note that for simplicity, ``amqtt_sub`` uses mostly the same argument syntax as `mosquitto_sub`_.

Configuration
-------------

If ``-c`` argument is given, ``amqtt_sub`` will read specific MQTT settings for the given configuration file. This file must be a valid `YAML`_ file which may contains the following configuration elements :

* ``keep_alive`` : Keep-alive timeout sent to the broker. Defaults to ``10`` seconds.
* ``ping_delay`` : Auto-ping delay before keep-alive timeout. Defaults to 1. Setting to ``0`` will disable to 0 and may lead to broker disconnection.
* ``default_qos`` : Default QoS for messages published. Defaults to 0.
* ``default_retain`` : Default retain value to messages published. Defaults to ``false``.
* ``auto_reconnect`` : Enable or disable auto-reconnect if connectection with the broker is interrupted. Defaults to ``false``.
* ``reconnect_retries`` : Maximum reconnection retries. Defaults to ``2``. Negative value will cause client to reconnect infinietly.
* ``reconnect_max_interval`` : Maximum interval between 2 connection retry. Defaults to ``10``.

Examples

Examples below are adapted from `mosquitto_sub`_ documentation.


Subscribe with QoS 0 to all messages published under $SYS/:
::

    amqtt_sub --url mqtt://localhost -t '$SYS/#' -q 0


Subscribe to 10 messages with QoS 2 from /#:
::

    amqtt_sub --url mqtt://localhost -t # -q 2 -n 10

.. _mosquitto_sub : http://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html

Subscribe with QoS 0 to all messages published under $SYS/: over mqtt encapsulated in a websocket connection and additional headers:
::

    amqtt_sub --url wss://localhost -t '$SYS/#' -q 0 --extra-headers '{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}'
